      "content": "# Jannik Sinner beats Carlos Alcaraz to win his first Wimbledon title. • **Men’s singles champion:** World No. 1 Jannik Sinner won his first Wimbledon title in a hard-fought battle with two-time reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz. Jannik Sinner is the men’s singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time after he came from a set down to beat two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Sinner looked to have taken control in the first set when he broke his opponent’s serve in the fifth game to take a 3-2 lead, only for Alcaraz to break back twice — the second time thanks in part to a suddenly nervous looking Sinner, who double-faulted to give the Spaniard an advantage, which he wasted no time in taking. Jannik Sinner defeats Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to win his first Wimbledon title. ## Alcaraz holds to make it 5-4, but Sinner serving for Wimbledon title. Alcaraz holds but Sinner can win the Wimbledon title by holding his next service game. Jannik Sinner serves to Carlos Alcaraz in the fourth set.",

      "content": "Iga Swiatek demolished Amanda Anisimova 6-0 6-0 in just 57 minutes - the first time a woman has won a final at Wimbledon without dropping a game since 1911, when Britain’s Dorothea Lambert Chambers triumphed by the same scoreline. “Be proud, Anisimova Amanda, Grand Slam finalist,” he wrote on X. “You’d have to be pretty cold not to feel for Amanda Anisimova,” added tennis commentator Craig Gabriel. “Amanda Anisimova crushed her speech in the most beautiful, serene way, and I’ll never forget it,” wrote tennis journo Chris Oddo. “This has been far more about Swiatek being great than Anisimova being awful,” opined tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg. Swiatek, 24, is just the second player in the Open era to win a major without losing a game in the final since Steffi Graf humbled Natalia Zvereva at the 1988 French Open. Swiatek, who now has 100 career Grand Slam match wins, has won the French Open four times and also the US Open, in 2022.",
